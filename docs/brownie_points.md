# Brownie Point Algorithm

Brownie Points is a Bradley-Terry model based algorithm which focuses on creating a human intuitive rating system.

## Math

The algorithm takes two inputs, which we'll call i and j.
Then, there are two factors we must calculate, one we'll call s, or our scale factor, and one which we'll call k, our k factor.
